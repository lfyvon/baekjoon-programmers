### 문제 설명

<p>In most languages, text is written from left to right. However, there are other languages where text is read and written from right to left. As a first step towards a program that automatically translates from a left-to-right language into a right-to-left language and back, you are to write a program that changes the direction of a given text.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The input file contains several test cases. The first line contains an integer specifying the number of test cases in the file. Each test case consists of a single line of text which contains at most 70 characters. However, the newline character at the end of each line is not considered to be part of the line.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, print a line containing the characters of the input line in reverse order.</p>
