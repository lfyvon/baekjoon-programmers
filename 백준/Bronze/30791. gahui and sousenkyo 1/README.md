### 문제 설명

<p>Gahui is watching the annual character election. After the election, <strong>The top 16 characters</strong> receive enormous benefits for one year because they belong to the Tier 1 (ranked 1st - 16th) section. For that reason, fans vote passionately to get their favorite characters into the top 16. Remarkably, at least one Cinderella appears in every election, achieving an outstanding outcome.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The character <strong>does not belong to the Tier 1</strong> section.</li>
	<li>The difference in votes between the character and the 16th-ranked character is<strong> $1\,000$ or less.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Find the competition rate of the election.</p>
