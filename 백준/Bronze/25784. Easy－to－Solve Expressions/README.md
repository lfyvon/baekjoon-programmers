<p>Given three distinct positive integers, you are to determine how one can be computed using the other two. Print 1 if any of the three numbers is the sum of the other two numbers, print 2 if any of the three numbers is the product of the other two numbers, print 3 otherwise. Assume that exactly one of these three messages will apply.</p>
