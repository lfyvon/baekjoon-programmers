### 문제 설명

<p><img alt="" src="https://upload.acmicpc.net/a33610a8-cdc1-44a2-9a38-de8e78ce86ac/-/preview/" style="width: 209px; height: 269px; float: right;">Now that Snapchat and Slingshot are soooo 2018, the teenagers of the world have all switched to the new hot app called BAPC (Bidirectional and Private Communication). This app has some stricter social rules than previous iterations. For example, if someone says goodbye using <code>Later!</code>, the other person is expected to reply with <code>Alligator!</code>. You can not keep track of all these social conventions and decide to automate any necessary responses, starting with the most important one: the greetings. When your conversational partner opens with <code>he...ey</code>, you have to respond with <code>hee...eey</code> as well, but using twice as many <code>e</code>’s!</p>

<p>Given a string of the form <code>he...ey</code> of length at most 1000, print the greeting you will respond with, containing twice as many <code>e</code>’s.</p>

### 입력 

 <ul>
	<li>The input consists of one line containing a single string s as specified, of length at least 3 and at most 1000.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>Output the required response.</p>
